<h1>Ahmed Mohamed</h1>
<p>Hello,My name is Ahmed Mohamed, I am a student at in the IMD program.
I would say I am an artistic person who loves all forms of artistic expression, my personal medium of artistic expression is drawing
I've been drawing since I was three years old which inspired a life love with the arts. I also love cooking and animals, especially cats. I own a cat called Milo, he is a large black and white cat and he is the love of my life.</p>
<p>I have had quite the journey ending up on in this program. I did all of my highschooling abroad and due to multiple factors struggled in alot in  highschool, and ended up graduating with relatively poor grades. I spent a few years after working before getting my GED and applicating to algonquin.</p>
<p>I dont regret that part of my life as said by famous english poet <em>Alfred Tennyson</em> "It's better to have tried and failed than to live life wondering what would've happened if I had tried." <source>https://best-quotations.com/</source>
